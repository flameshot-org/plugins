# Flameshot plugins

The central repository for [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) plugins. You should consider each plugin as a separate project with separate licenses and maintainers. The reason they are in this repository is to have the full catalog in once place which helps with discoverability, and also provides the possibility of having another plugin as dependency. Additionally, it would ultimately help us to have a GUI menu for the user to install plugins from inside Flameshot and avoid manually juggling the files.

## Disclaimer

> [!WARNING]
> Note that the plugins here should be considered as third-party and should be used at your own risk. Flameshot project has **zero responsibility** about these plugins and you should also treat them as such. The code is in this repo, make sure you review them and use them responsibly.


## Bug Reporting / Feature Requests

As mentioned before, these plugins are independent projects collected under the same repo. So if you want to report a bug, please always use the plugin name in the title and the ` -- ` and then the rest. It would also make it easier if you mention the developer of that plugin in the text, as they would be notified immediately.


## Licensing

We encourage all plugins to use GPLv3, but this is not enforced, and is merely a suggestion. But in the spirit of the Flameshot project, we require plugins to be one of the approved licenses by OpenSource Initiative (OSI): https://opensource.org/licenses
